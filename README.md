### Work IN Progress Project (Active Project)

Building Neural Networks from scratch using only NUMPY

This project is a work-in-progress implementation of a neural network from scratch. The goal is to build a functional neural network library using only NumPy, for educational purposes.

#### Current Features:
*   Dense layer implementation
*   Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax, Linear

#### Future Goals:
*   Implement backpropagation
*   Add different layer types (e.g., convolutional)
*   Create a model class to manage layers
